# ti83plus-stuff
This is basically everything I have programmed on a TI-83+. Most of them are from 2010. They might be compatible with the TI-84+, not guaranteed though. Some games are unfinished. All of them include Source Code, except for the Mario 2.0 Levels.

## Installation
Put all files in the folder on to your calculator, then run them from the PRGM-Menu.

## Games (Finished)

### ASCIIRAC + ASCIIED
Very simple racing game using the home screen as graphics. Includes a Editor (ASCIIED) which is required because I have not included any tracks and you have to build a track for yourself.

#### ASCIIRAC controls
    Left: Move Left
    Right: Move Right

#### ASCIIED controls
    Left: Place curve left
    Up: Place straight
    Right: Place curve right
    ^: Save and Exit
    
Note: Every track piece is about 2 frames (about 0.5 seconds) long

### FTUNNEL

A sideways cave game. You are a worm which goes to the right. After you have reached the right side of the screen it loops. In the Menu you must run "2:INSTALL + PLAY" the first time you are playing.

#### FTUNNEL controls
    Up: Move up
    Down: Move down

### WILDGNMN

A Wild Gunman clone. This one is one of my favourites. Features a HighScore system with name input and stuff.

#### Wild Gunman controls

      Up: Menu Up
      Down: Menu Down

## Games (unfinished)

### DSGAME + DSINST

Some kind of tribalwars clone. It is in german. Basically not much is working, you can try to build something and it will count down the time but it never finishes the building. Run DSINST first.

### RPG

An attempt at creating a RPG Engine. Has some nice Menus and a Pi walking on screen.

### Vector

A vector drawing program. Draws a line in 3D space or a box. Apperantly can do some calculations, not sure if they are correct.

### Textdraw

Some weird Text drawing thing. You can enter many Characters, punctuation stuff is found under ".", numbers are hidden in Theta. Saves the text you have entered. The Textread is the same program but it reads a file instead, well kind of.

## Mario Levels (mariolvl)
Level Packs I did for Mario 2.0.

### Missing
The X is Missing Level packs. All of them are very difficult.
